  tagline: "Hi, I'm Afonso, a curious 33-year-old man who lives in Rio and
           works as Full-Stack developer at the great <a href=\"http://veriz.com.br\">Veriz Tecnologia</a>!"

  intro: I love coding and I've been doing this since I was a teenager. The first time I created a program,
          I was trying to build a RPG within Excel.

          Nowadays my job is a little different, but it's still fun.

          I'm also an MBA in Project Management from <a href=\"http://fgv.br\">FGV</a> and
          graduated in Computer Science at <a href=\"http://ubm.br/\">UBM</a>.

          Here you can know more about me and my job. Enjoy!
